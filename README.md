## 🌬️ Windfall Engine
**The Multi-Modal Game Engine for Python.**

Windfall is a flexible, light-weight game engine designed to bridge the gap between retro terminal interfaces and modern graphical displays. Build your game logic once, and deploy it across three distinct modes.

### 🚀 The Vision: One Core, Three Renderers
Windfall allows developers to focus on "The Brain" of their game while providing swappable "Eyes" for different platforms:

* **🕹️ TUI Mode:** High-performance terminal interface using `blessed`. Perfect for SSH-based games and minimalist roguelikes.
* **🎨 2D Mode:** Polished graphical experience powered by `pygame`.
* **⛰️ 3D Mode:** Immersive spatial environments (Godot/Panda3D Integration).

### 🛠️ Installation (Alpha)
Currently in development. You can install the core engine directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+[https://github.com/timothyburt/windfall-engine.git](https://github.com/timothyburt/windfall-engine.git)
